# 🎬 Movies Text Splitter Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Built

A complete text splitter visualization system that demonstrates how LangChain-style text splitting works with embeddings and vector databases.

## 📁 Files Created

### Database Schema & Functions
1. **movies_table.sql** - Creates the `movies` table with vector embedding support
2. **match_movies.sql** - Semantic similarity search function for movie chunks

### Backend (Server-side)
3. **server.js** (updated) - Added 4 new API endpoints:
   - `POST /api/movies/process` - Process movies.txt with text splitter
   - `GET /api/movies` - Retrieve all movie chunks
   - `POST /api/movies/search` - Semantic search in movie chunks
   - `DELETE /api/movies` - Clear all movie chunks
   
   Also added helper function: `splitTextByCharacter()` - Character-based text splitter with overlap

### Frontend (Client-side)
4. **movies.html** - Complete UI with 3 main sections:
   - Process & configure text splitting
   - Visualize text chunks
   - Search similar content

5. **movies.css** - Modern, responsive styling with:
   - Gradient header design
   - Card-based layout
   - Interactive chunk visualization
   - Search results styling

6. **movies.js** - Full JavaScript functionality:
   - Text processing & chunk creation
   - Load existing chunks from database
   - Clear all chunks
   - Semantic search implementation
   - Dynamic UI updates

### Documentation
7. **MOVIES_README.md** - Complete setup and usage guide

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. Text Splitting ✅
- Character-based splitting with configurable chunk size (50-1000 chars)
- Configurable overlap (0-200 chars)
- Smart boundary detection (sentence/word breaks)
- Similar to LangChain's CharacterTextSplitter

### 2. Embeddings ✅
- Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model
- Creates 1536-dimensional vectors for each chunk
- Batch processing for efficiency

### 3. Vector Database Integration ✅
- Stores chunks and embeddings in Supabase
- Uses pgvector extension for vector operations
- Efficient indexing with IVFFlat

### 4. Visualization ✅
- Grid-based chunk display
- Shows chunk ID and character count
- Hover effects for better UX
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### 5. Semantic Search ✅
- Natural language query support
- Configurable result limit (1-20)
- Adjustable similarity threshold (0-1)
- Results show similarity percentage and interpretation
- Ranked by relevance

## 🔄 Workflow

```
movies.txt
    ↓
[Text Splitter] → Chunks with overlap
    ↓
[OpenAI Embeddings] → 1536-dim vectors
    ↓
[Supabase pgvector] → Storage + Indexing
    ↓
[Semantic Search] → Similar content retrieval
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Setup Database** (One-time)
   - Run `movies_table.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run `match_movies.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

2. **Start Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open Browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/movies.html`

4. **Process Movies**
   - Set chunk size and overlap
   - Click "Process & Store Chunks"
   - Wait for processing to complete

5. **View Chunks**
   - Chunks automatically display after processing
   - Or click "Load Existing Chunks" to reload

6. **Search**
   - Enter a query (e.g., "action movies")
   - Adjust settings
   - Click "Search"

## 🎨 UI Design Highlights

- **Modern gradient design** matching the existing site style
- **Three-step workflow** clearly separated into cards
- **Real-time feedback** with loading states and error messages
- **Interactive elements** with hover effects and animations
- **Responsive layout** works on mobile and desktop
- **Info section** explains the technology

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Text Splitter Algorithm
- Configurable chunk size and overlap
- Smart boundary detection (tries to break at sentences/words)
- Handles edge cases (last chunk, no good break points)
- Overlap ensures context preservation

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints
- Consistent error handling
- Detailed response objects
- Validation for all inputs

### Frontend Architecture
- Separation of concerns (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Event-driven architecture
- Clean error handling
- Responsive state management

## 📊 Example Use Cases

1. **Movie Recommendations**
   - Query: "superhero movies"
   - Finds: Blue Beetle, Expend4bles, etc.

2. **Genre Search**
   - Query: "comedy with family"
   - Finds: Barbie, Elemental, etc.

3. **Theme-based Search**
   - Query: "mystery and detective"
   - Finds: Glass Onion, A Haunting in Venice

4. **Director/Actor Search**
   - Query: "Christopher Nolan"
   - Finds: Oppenheimer

## 🎓 Educational Value
